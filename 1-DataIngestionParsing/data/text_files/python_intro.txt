Python supports multiple programming paradigms, including procedural, object-oriented, and functional programming. It has a large standard library that provides tools suited to many tasks, making it a popular choice for web development, data analysis, artificial intelligence, scientific computing, and more. Python's syntax emphasizes code readability, allowing developers to express concepts in fewer lines of code compared to other languages. Its extensive ecosystem of third-party packages and frameworks further enhances its versatility and functionality.
